Hello,

We have released Stacks version 2.0.6, available here: https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/releases/tag/2.0.6.

Miners in particular are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, because the changes make block-mining more reliable.  In particular, issue #2444 has been fixed, which ensures that a miner does not accidentally waste all its Bitcoin trying to mine Stacks blocks in one Bitcoin block.

Changelog:

## [2.0.6] - 2021-02-15

The database schema has not changed since 2.0.5, so when spinning up a
2.0.6 node from a 2.0.5 chainstate, you do not need to use a fresh
working directory. Earlier versions' chainstate directories are
incompatible, however.

### Fixed

- Miner RBF logic has two "fallback" logic changes. First, if the RBF
  logic has increased fees by more than 50%, do not submit a new
  transaction. Second, fix the "same chainstate hash" fallback check.
- Winning block txid lookups in the SortitionDB have been corrected
  to use the txid during the lookup.
- The miner will no longer attempt to mine a new Stacks block if it receives a
  microblock in a discontinuous microblock stream.
